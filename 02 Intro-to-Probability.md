# Introduction to Probability

## Definitions
* Experiment
* Trial
* Event
* Outcome
* Probability: a numeric measurement inidcating the liklihood that an event will occur

## Probability Assignments
* Classic Probability (ie. coin flipping)
* Relative Frequency Assignment (ie. experimental results from a small sample - mail-out response)

The symbol **P(E<sub>1</sub>)** means *the probability of an event E1 occuring*.

## Probability Relationships
1. Non-Negativity: Probability can never be negative.
2. Bounded by Zero and 1: `0 < P(E) < 1`
3. Certain Events: `P(E) = 1`
