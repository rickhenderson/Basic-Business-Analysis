# Introduction to Probability

## Definitions
* Experiment
* Trial
* Event
* Outcome
* Probability: a numeric measurement inidcating the liklihood that an event will occur

## Probability Assignments
* Classic Probability (ie. coin flipping)
* Relative Frequency Assignment (ie. experimental results from a small sample - mail-out response)

The symbol **P(E<sub>1</sub>)** means *the probability of an event E<sub>1</sub> occuring*.

## Probability Relationships
1. Non-Negativity: Probability can never be negative.
2. Bounded by Zero and 1: `0 < P(E) < 1`
3. Certain Events: `P(E) = 1`
4. Impossible Events: `P(I) = 0`
5. Mutually Exclusive Events: An event cannot both occur and not occur. If **A** is the event, let **Ā** be the event that does not occur. `P(A) = 1 - P(Ā)` I cannot both be born in Canada and not born in Canada at the same time.
6. Sum of Probabilities: The sum of all probabilities must be 1.

*The collection of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called the universe of probabilities.*

7. Independent events: Two events that do not affect the outcome of each other are called independent. The probability of both events occuring is the product of the probabilities.
```
  P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
```
8. Possible Occurences: If there are m ways an event can occur out of a total of n ways, the probability is m/n.
```
  You have a bag that contains 4 red balls and 1 black ball. 
  The probability of pulling a black ball is P(B) = 1/5 = 0.2 = 20%.
