# Financial Analysis

## Chapter 1: Introduction
* Accounting Analysis deals with many types of costs. Financial Analysis deals with relative, future, and relevant costs. The two are separate and have different purposes.

## Chapter 2: Cost Concepts
* An analyst often has to capture the cost of doing something: buying a product, hiring a person, etc. Something related to either a product, project, system, or operation.

* Relative Cost: The analyst doesn't really care how much A costs, but they are interested in the difference in cost between A and B.
* Almost always dealing with future costs, or estimates.
* Be aware of the potential faulty accounting perspective of actual cost.
