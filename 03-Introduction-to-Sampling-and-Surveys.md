# Introduction to Sampling and Surveys

* Basic equations for **mean** and **standard deviation**.
* Example of Fred sampling Charlie's strawberries illustrates the importance of sampling in business.

## Lessons learned to apply to business operations
* Don't make assumptions about whether or not your business associate has done things properly. Check things for yourself to be sure that everything is as it should be.
* If something is amiss with one item, don't assume that only this item is defective. It is possible that the entire group of items is defective due to a systemic fault.
* If the group of items is small, say four or five, then you probably should check all of them.
* If the group of items is large, say 15 or more, conduct a random sample of the group and check those items. If your sample items are also faulty, then it's likely that all-or most-of the remaining are also faulty.
* Take appropriate action based on the findings of your random sample.
